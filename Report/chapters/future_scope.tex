\section{Future scope}
%\textit{Authors:}
For further research it would be necessary to investigate Hyperledger more intense. This is especially because of the lack of time that resulted in small numbers of transaction in the Hyperledger setup. To improve the results in that matter the number of transactions has to be increased.
\\
In addition to that, Hyperledger was used with the Burrow framework only. That is why in further experiments the variety of frameworks that were tested has to be increased.

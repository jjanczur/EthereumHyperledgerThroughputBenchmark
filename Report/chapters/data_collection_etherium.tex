\subsection{Methods of data collection}
In case of Ethereum, all necessary data could be found directly in the logs generated by Geth. For this purpose, we developed a parser that went through the log files extracting relevant information and storing it in a CSV file. By relevant information, we mean the number of transactions for each block ($T_b$) as well as timestamps of the first submitted transaction ($t_{T_0}$) and last committed block ($t_{b_N}$). Knowing block frequency ($F$), total number of transactions ($N$) and being able to parse everything else, it became trivial to calculate throughput according to the definitions presented in subsection \ref{throughput}.

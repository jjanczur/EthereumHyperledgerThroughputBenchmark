For Hyperledger Burrow, the logs were used as well. The arrival and execution timestamps as well as the hash of a 
received transaction were logged. With an own written parser, these timestamps could be extracted and used for the calculation
of the throughput. The sending of multiple transactions at once was done by another self-written tool. The communication of the
Blockchain and the clients was implemented by Burrow via TCP. Because this resulted in a round-trip time of about one second, a thread pool
was used to increase the number of parallel transactions.

 Blockchain is not a normal BASE or ACID database, where transactions are executed immediately after submitting. In case of blockchain transactions are stored in blocks and than they are commonly added to a blockchain.
 As it is clearly visible in Table \ref{table:2}, measuring throughput for the number of transactions less then the block capacity is pointless. That is why we present AVG filtered values where we do not include the measurements for $tx < 500$.
